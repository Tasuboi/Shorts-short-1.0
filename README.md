# Shorts-short-1.0
 Social Media Consumption Management Tool

It is a simple google extention for Youtube where a user can set a limit to their daily Youtube shorts consumption.
When the limit is reached, it will show a pop up notification.

It increases the count of shorts watched by detecting if the url has the word "shorts" in it.

# What I learned:
- How to make a google extention.
- A better understanding of JavaScript and HTML.
- Many Manifest_version 2 Api's do not work with Manifest_version 3.
- Some websites have restrictions for HTML changes and Script injections.
